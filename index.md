Course Description
----
Use a hardware description language to describe and design digital systems. Processor design, pipelining, cache and storage systems. Instruction and thread level parallelism, speculation, branch prediction.

Course Objectives
----
By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to:

* Design, simulate, and describe the complete operation of a computer system (ABET a, b, c, k).
* Understand and apply computer architecture principles such as Amdahl's law, parallelism and locality to analyze the performance of different computer systems. (ABET a, e).
* Identify and utilize the various forms of parallelism (ILP, DLP, TLP, etc) to increase system performance.

Textbook
----

We will be closely following parts of the Hennessy and Patterson textbook. All of the material will be presented in class as lecture slides or papers. Some people may be succesfful from the class notes alone. However, depending on your learning style, you may find it useful to read the text. One copy is on reserve at the library for occasional use. If you are a book learner or plan to pursue graduate studies in a related field, obtaining a copy of the text is highly recommended.

**Recommended**

* Hennessy and Patterson, "[Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/012383872X)", 5th Edition. ISBN  978-0123838728. One copy is on reserve fro this course at the library. The library also has the [eBook version available](http://bucknell.eblib.com/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=787253) (Bucknell login required).
* Patterson and Hennessy, "[Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface](http://amzn.com/0124077269)", 5th Edition. ISBN 978-0124077263. This is the required text for CSCI206. One copy is on reserve for this course at the library. The eBook is not yet available.

**Reference**

* Samir Palnitkar, "[Verilog HDL](http://www.amazon.com/Verilog-HDL-paperback-2nd-Edition/dp/0132599708)", 2nd Edition. ISBN 978-0132599702. One copy is on reserve for this course at the library. No eBook.

Policies
=====

Attendance and Participation
-----
An important part of the class is your active participation in lecture sections. If people do not show up to lecture, or do other work (or sleep) while in lecture, it degrades the quality of the class for everyone. Therefore, all students are expected to attend and actively participate in all lectures. If you have to miss a class please contact the instructor **at least 24 hours prior to the start of that class**. You will be responsible for making up any/all missed work.

Grading
-----

Your instructor will make every effort to promptly return all graded work to you (usually by the next schedule class). Overall grades will be sent to you via your Bucknell email address after the first midterm exam and again in the last week of classes. If you would like to discuss your grade at any time, please make an [**appointment**](https://doodle.com/amm042).

Component | Grade
----      | ----
Course Project (Lab)* | 50%
Activities & Quizzes  |  10%
Midterm Exam | 15%
Final Exam* | 25%

**\*** to pass the course you must pass both the Verilog Project and Final exam (separately).

Letter grades will then be assigned using the typical scale:

Score | Grade
----  | -----
93    | A
90-92 | A-
87-89 | B+
83-86 | B
80-82 | B-
77-79 | C+
73-76 | C
70-72 | C-
60-69 | D
<60   | F

Bonus points may occasionally be available.

If you think you find a grading error, you may request a regrade. Regrade requests must be recieved no later than **72 hours after the assignment/exam is returned**. It is possible for the new grade to be lower than the original grade. In all cases the most recent grade is used (not the highest grade).

Late Work
-----
Late work will not be accepted unless you receive permission from the instructor **>24 hours before it is due**.

Accommodations
-----
If you have a University recognized accommodation please let your instructor know. Your instructor will be happy to work with you.
