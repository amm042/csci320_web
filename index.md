Course Description
----
Use a hardware description language to describe and design digital systems. Processor design, pipelining, cache and storage systems. Instruction and thread level parallelism, speculation, branch prediction.

Course Objectives
----
By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to:

* Design, simulate, and describe the complete operation of a computer system (ABET a, b, c, k).
* Understand and apply computer architecture principles such as Amdahl's law, parallelism and locality to analyze the performance of different computer systems. (ABET a, e).
* Identify and utilize the various forms of parallelism (ILP, DLP, TLP, etc) to increase system performance.
