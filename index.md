Course Description
----
Use a hardware description language to describe and design digital systems. Processor design, pipelining, cache and storage systems. Instruction and thread level parallelism, speculation, branch prediction.

Course Objectives
----
By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to:

* Design, simulate, and describe the complete operation of a computer system (ABET a, b, c, k).
* Understand and apply computer architecture principles such as Amdahl's law, parallelism and locality to analyze the performance of different computer systems. (ABET a, e).
* Identify and utilize the various forms of parallelism (ILP, DLP, TLP, etc) to increase system performance. 


ABET Outcomes

Attendance and Participation
-----
An important part of the class is your active participation. If people do not show up to class or do other work (or sleep) while in class it degrades the quality of the class for everyone. Therefore, all students are expected to attend and actively participate in all classes and labs. If you have to miss a class please contact the instructor **at least 24 hours prior to the start of that class**.
